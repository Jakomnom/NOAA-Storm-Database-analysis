# NOAA Storm Data Analysis

## Introduction
Storms and other severe weather events can cause significant public health and economic challenges for communities and municipalities. Many severe events result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage. Understanding these events and their impacts is crucial for mitigating risks and improving preparedness.

This project explores the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including the timing, location, and estimates of fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

## Data
The dataset used in this analysis is provided in a comma-separated value (CSV) format and compressed using the bzip2 algorithm to reduce its size. The data can be downloaded from the following link:

Additional documentation regarding the dataset is available at:

- [National Climatic Data Center - Storm Events FAQ](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/faq.jsp)

The dataset contains records from 1950 to November 2011. In the early years, fewer events were recorded, likely due to limited record-keeping. More recent years contain more comprehensive and reliable data.
